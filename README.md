# cs50x-problem-sets
This repository contains 4 problem sets I have solved while taking cs50x - an introductory computer science course offered by Harvard University. The course is 11-week long with many problems sets, labs, and practices each week. For more information, please visit this webpage: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/

## Summary of c scripts in this repository
- [**atoi.c**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/3/atoi/) is a program to convert a string to an int using recursion.
- [**plurality.c**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/plurality/) is a voting program. Users will enter the name of the candidates. After that, a number of voters is required. The program will ask the user to enter individual vote depending on the number of voters. Finally, the candidate(s) with most votes will be identified be printed to screen.
- [**prime.c**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/problems/1/prime/) is a simple program using "for loops" to look for prime numbers between a range specified by users.
- [**substitution.c**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/2/substitution/) is a program that uses a user-specified 26 characters "key" to substitute every letter of a text, thereby encrypting it. The key in this case represents the new order English alphabet characters.
